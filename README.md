# Crime-Visualization
A simple tool to view geolocated crime data superimposed on a google maps object. Data was collected from city government sources such as Socrata and NYC Open Data. Currently, 3 cities (Fort-Worth, Chicago, NYC) are supported. The user can view crime maps for any FBI crime code and timeframe for which data is available.
