# Crime-Visualization
A simple tool to view a heatmap of geolocated crime data superimposed on a google maps object. Currently, 3 cities (Fort-Worth, Chicago, NYC) are supported. The user can view crime maps for any FBI crime code and timeframe for which data is available. The program produces a google maps html file representing the data, which it then renders on a browser. Data was collected from city government sources such as Socrata and NYC Open Data. A couple examples are shown (PNG files).
